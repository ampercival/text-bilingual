# Slide 1 - Why bilingualism matters

Good evening everyone, and thank you for being here.

I want to start with a simple idea. In Canada, a “hello” and a “bonjour” are never just words. They are small signals of respect and belonging. When we take the time to greet people in both official languages, we are telling them that they have a place in the room and a place in the conversation.

Bilingualism is sometimes treated as a rule or a box to check. I see it differently. It is a bridge that helps us cross the distance between people who might otherwise stay on opposite sides of the room. When we make a real effort in someone’s language, even if the grammar is not perfect, we are reaching their heart as well as their head.

Tonight I want to talk about what bilingualism really looks like in daily life. Why it matters for trust and results, what makes it hard, and how each of us can move from good intentions to visible habits that support both English and French in Canada.

# Slide 2 - Bilingualism in daily work and service

Let us bring this down to the world we work in every day.

Language is not an abstract issue. When we serve the public, it can be the difference between someone who understands their rights and someone who walks away confused. During a crisis, language can be the difference between clear instructions and dangerous uncertainty. Inside a team, language can decide whether a colleague feels safe to speak up or stays silent.

We see the same thing in our internal work. When a meeting starts with a few sentences in both languages, the room feels different. When documents arrive in English and French at the same time, it sends a clear message about fairness and respect. People notice. It tells them that they should not have to set aside their language in order to participate.

So bilingualism is not just a noble idea. It shapes service quality, safety, trust and how included people feel at work. That is why the effort is worth making, even when it takes a bit more time.

# Slide 3 - Challenges and mindset: effort, not perfection

Of course, we all know that living bilingualism every day is not easy.

Time is tight. Meetings are full. Many of us feel that our second language is rusty or that our accent is too strong. Some worry that switching languages will slow things down or make the conversation less natural. These concerns are real, and it is important to name them honestly.

The goal is not perfection. The goal is steady, visible effort. It can start small. Greet people in both languages. Learn one short sentence you can use to switch from one language to the other. Share your key messages in both languages, even if the detailed discussion happens mainly in one. When you chair a meeting, invite people to use the language they are most comfortable with, and give them the time to do it.

These are small steps, but they send a strong signal. They show that bilingualism is not only a line in a policy. It is part of how we live and work together.

# Slide 4 - The role of leaders and bilingual colleagues

Leaders have a special role in all of this.

When a leader makes space for both official languages, others feel permission to do the same. When a leader tries, stumbles, and carries on, it tells everyone that learning is welcome. When a leader takes the time to send a message or open a meeting in both languages, people notice and remember. Culture shifts through visible habits at the top as much as through formal rules.

There is also a key role for those who are already strong in both languages. If that is you, your skills are a gift to the people around you. You can offer to practise with colleagues before an important presentation. You can be patient when someone is searching for a word. You can encourage, instead of correcting in a way that embarrasses them.

Every supportive reaction builds confidence. Every impatient reaction makes someone less likely to try again. If we want more bilingualism in practice, we need a supportive environment that makes it safe to take risks.

# Slide 5 - A simple invitation: small habits, real change

Let me end with a simple invitation.

Choose one concrete habit that will bring more of both official languages into your daily life. It might be sending your next email greeting in both languages. It might be adding a short bilingual opening to your next presentation. It might be taking a minute at the end of a meeting to recap the key points in the other language. Start small, stay consistent, and see how people respond.

I also think about the next generation watching us. Somewhere a child is sitting at a kitchen table, struggling with vocabulary lists and wondering why this matters. That child will learn more from what we do than from what we say. If they see leaders, neighbours and co-workers making space for both languages, they will understand that bilingualism is part of how we live together in Canada.

Thank you for the efforts you already make, seen and unseen, to honour both official languages. Every greeting, every sentence, every brave attempt in a second language is a small step toward a more open and respectful country.
