Good evening, everyone, and thank you for being here.

We are gathered in a country where a simple “hello” and “bonjour” can change the way people feel in a room. Language is more than vocabulary. It signals respect, belonging, and the promise that everyone has a place in the conversation. That is why I wanted to speak tonight about what it really means to live and work in a bilingual country, and how each of us can make that real in our daily lives.

For many of us, our second official language did not start as a love story. It started with verb tables, awkward accents, and the fear of making mistakes in front of classmates. I still remember the first time I tried to give even a short bilingual speech. My notes were shaking, my grammar was far from perfect, and I was sure people would judge every error. What I discovered instead was something different: people were grateful that I tried.

That experience taught me a simple lesson. When we speak to people in their first language, we reach their minds. When we make an effort in their own language, even if it is not perfect, we reach their hearts. In Canada, that effort matters. It matters in our public institutions, in our workplaces, and in our communities. It says: “You belong here. Your language belongs here.”

Bilingualism is sometimes described as a rule to follow or a box to check. I think we need a different picture. Bilingualism is a bridge that helps us cross the distance between people who might otherwise stand on opposite sides of a room. When a meeting starts in English and then we hear a few sentences in French, the room changes. When a document arrives in both languages at the same time, it sends a clear message about fairness and respect.

There are also very practical reasons to care about this. When we serve the public, language can be the difference between someone understanding their rights, or leaving confused. In a crisis, language can be the difference between clear instructions and dangerous uncertainty. In a team, language can be the difference between a colleague who speaks up and one who stays silent. These are simple examples, yet they show that bilingualism is not an abstract ideal. It is something that affects results, trust, and safety.

At the same time, we all know that living bilingualism every day is not always easy. Time is tight. Meetings are full. Many of us feel that our second language is rusty or that our accent is too strong. Some worry that switching languages will slow things down. Those concerns are real, and it is important to name them. The goal is not perfection. The goal is steady, visible effort.

So what does that effort look like in practice? It can start with small habits. Greet people in both languages. Learn a short sentence you can use to switch from one language to the other. Share your key messages in both languages, even if the detailed discussion happens mainly in one. When you chair a meeting, invite people to speak in the language they are most comfortable with, and give them time to do so. These actions do not require perfection, only intention.

Leaders have a special role to play. When a leader makes space for both official languages, others feel permission to do the same. When a leader tries, stumbles, and keeps going, they send a powerful signal that learning is welcome. When a leader takes the time to send a message in both languages, people notice. Culture often changes in small, visible steps, not in grand announcements.

There is also a role for those who are already strong in both languages. If that is you, your skills are a gift to the people around you. Offer to help colleagues practise before an important presentation. Be patient when someone searches for a word. Encourage, instead of correcting in a way that embarrasses. Every supportive reaction builds confidence; every impatient reaction makes someone less likely to try again.

I want to be honest as well. There will be moments when bilingualism feels like extra work. Writing two versions of a text takes longer. Preparing a bilingual speech takes practice. Taking turns around the table in both languages can stretch a meeting. Yet when we look at the long term, this work strengthens trust, builds understanding, and keeps a promise that sits at the heart of our country. That promise is simple: you should not have to set aside your language in order to take part.

For myself, I still make mistakes in my second language every single week. I still search for words and sometimes choose the wrong one. I still have days when I feel tired and tempted to stay in the easier language. What keeps me going is the look on someone’s face when they realise I am trying to meet them where they are. That look is a quiet reminder that the effort is worth it.

So here is my invitation to you after tonight. Choose one concrete habit that will bring more of both official languages into your daily life. It might be sending your next email greeting in both languages. It might be adding a short bilingual opening to your next presentation. It might be asking for a few minutes at the end of a meeting to recap the key points in the other language. Start small, stay consistent, and notice how people respond.

As we look ahead, I think about the next generation watching us. Somewhere in this country, a child is sitting at a kitchen table, struggling with vocabulary lists in English or French and wondering why it matters. That child will learn more from what we do than from what we say. If they see leaders, neighbours, and co-workers making space for both languages, they will understand that bilingualism is not just a school requirement. It is part of the way we live together.

Thank you for the chance to speak with you this evening. Thank you for the efforts you already make, seen and unseen, to honour both of our official languages. Every greeting, every sentence, every brave attempt in a second language is a small step toward a more open and respectful country. I am grateful to be taking those steps with you.
